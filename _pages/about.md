My name is Gerardo, and I'm currently in the ninth semester of the BSc in Economics at UNAM. Since August 2025, I've been working at the Governing Board of Banco de México as an Intern, collaborating on research and policy-related projects. In 2025, my team and I won the Reto Banxico 2025, placing first among 294 teams nationwide.

I also work as a Research Assistant to MSc Benjamín Oliva Vázquez at the Faculty of Economics (UNAM), supporting the development of course content focused on structural shocks in VAR models and Kalman Filter applications. In addition, I serve as a Teaching Assistant for the Time Series Analysis course at UNAM.

I am currently working on my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of PhD Juan Carlos Moreno-Brid, focusing on the impact of uncertainty on investment. I am particularly interested in Macroeconomics dynamics and Monetary Policy, using empirical tool such as Time Series Analysis and Causal Inference. 

I love music production and listening to music, especially R&B and Hip-Hop. I’m also really into sports like soccer, football, basketball, and padel. I'm the proud dad of Spike, a Rat Terrier who loves pizza and chicken. I enjoy understanding how things work—especially the universe.
