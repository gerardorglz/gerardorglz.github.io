My name is Gerardo, and I am currently in the eighth semester of the BSc in Economics at UNAM. Since March 2025, I've been working at the Institute for Economic Research (IIEc-UNAM) as a Research Assistant to PhD Monika Meireles, contributing to the development of research papers. In 2025, my team and I reached the semifinals of the Reto Banxico 2025, placing among the top 10 out of 150 teams nationwide. 

I am currently working on my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of PhD Juan Carlos Moreno-Brid, focusing on Balance-of-Payments-Constrained Growth and Green Transition. My areas of interest include Economic Growth, Green Transition, Macroeconomics, Time Series Analysis, and Causal Inference.

I love music production and listening to music, especially R&B and Hip-Hop. I’m also really into sports like soccer, football, basketball, and padel. I'm the proud dad of Spike, a Rat Terrier who loves pizza and chicken. I enjoy understanding how things work—especially the universe.
