My name is Gerardo, and I'm currently in the ninth semester of the BSc in Economics at UNAM. Since August 2025, I've been working at the Governing Board of Banco de Mexico as an Intern, collaborating on research and policy-related projects. In 2025, my team and I won the Reto Banxico 2025, placing first among 294 teams nationwide.

I also serve as a Teaching Assistant at the Faculty of Economics (UNAM) with MSc Benjamín Olíva Vázquez, supporting the design of the undergraduate course "Time Series Analysis" and delivering the laboratory sessions.

I am currently working on my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of PhD Juan Carlos Moreno-Brid, focusing on the impact of uncertainty on investment. I am particularly interested in Macroeconomics dynamics and Monetary Policy, using empirical tools such as Time Series Analysis and Causal Inference. 

I love music production and listening to music, especially R&B and Hip-Hop. I’m also really into sports like soccer, football, basketball, and padel. I'm the proud dad of Spike, a Rat Terrier who loves pizza and chicken. I enjoy understanding how things work—especially the universe.
