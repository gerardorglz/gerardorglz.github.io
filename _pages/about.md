My name is Gerardo, and I'm currently in the ninth semester of the BSc in Economics at UNAM. Since March 2025, I've been working at the Institute for Economic Research (IIEc-UNAM) as a Research Assistant to PhD Monika Meireles, contributing to the development of research papers. In 2025, my team and I won the Reto Banxico 2025, placing first among 294 teams nationwide.

I am currently working on my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of PhD Juan Carlos Moreno-Brid, focusing on the Macroecomic effects of the Energy Transition. I am particularly interested in the dynamics of Economic Growth and the Energy Transition. My work also draws on Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy, using empirical tools such as Time Series Analysis and Causal Inference.

I love music production and listening to music, especially R&B and Hip-Hop. I’m also really into sports like soccer, football, basketball, and padel. I'm the proud dad of Spike, a Rat Terrier who loves pizza and chicken. I enjoy understanding how things work—especially the universe.
