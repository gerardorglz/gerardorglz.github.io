My name is Gerardo, and I am currently in the eighth semester of my Bachelor's degree in Economics at UNAM. Since March 2025, I have been working at the Institute for Economic Research (IIEc-UNAM) as a Research Assistant to PhD Monika Meireles, contributing to the development of research papers. In 2025, my team and I reached the semifinals of the Reto Banxico 2025, placing among the top 10 out of 150 teams nationwide. 

I am currently working on my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of PhD Juan Carlos Moreno-Brid, focusing on Balance-of-Payments-Constrained Growth and the Energy Transition. My areas of interest include Economic Growth, Macroeconomics, Time Series Analysis, and Causal Inference.
