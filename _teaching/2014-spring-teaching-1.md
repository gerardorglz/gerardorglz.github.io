Since May 2025, I have been collaborating in the writing and revision of content for the undergraduate course "Time Series Analysis", taught by **MSc Benjamín Oliva Vázquez**.

My contributions have focused on drafting theoretical materials and implementing the identification of structural innovations in Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models using *R* and *MatLab*, through methods such as Cholesky Decomposition, Long-Run Restrictions, and Sign Restrictions, employing libraries such as *tseries*, *vars*, *svars*, and the *VAR-Toolbox* for *MatLab*.

Additionally, I have supported the development of materials related to the Kalman Filter, including the fundamentals of State-Space Models, the Kalman Algorithm, and Variance Decomposition, as well as their applications in Economics, particularly in *semi-structural and structural models*, using *MatLab*.
