Since May 2025, I've been collaborating in the writing and revision of content for the undergraduate course *"Time Series Analysis"*, taught by **MSc Benjamín Oliva Vázquez**. <br><br>
My contributions have focused on drafting theoretical materials and implementing the identification of structural innovations in Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models using *R* and *MatLab*, through methods such as Cholesky Decomposition, Long-Run Restrictions, and Sign Restrictions, employing libraries such as *tseries*, *vars*, *svars*, and the *VAR-Toolbox* for *MatLab*. <br><br>
I also teach the lab sessions, where we review and reproduce examples of VAR models presented in academic papers to help students connect theory with applied research.
