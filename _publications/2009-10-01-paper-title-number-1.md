The text examines Michal Kalecki's influence on Maria da Conceição Tavares's analysis of Latin American development in the 1970s. It highlights four key areas: effective demand, business cycles, intersectoral dynamics, and the role of investment financing. The latter is emphasized as a crucial yet understudied aspect.
